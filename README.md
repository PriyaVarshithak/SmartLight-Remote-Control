# SmartLight-Remote-Control

This repository contains the implementation of a novel architecture for a low-cost and flexible light control and monitoring system using an Android-based smartphone. The proposed architecture utilizes a micro web server and application layer for communication between the remote user and home light. Any Android-based smartphone with built-in support for Wi-Fi can be used to access and control the devices at home. In situations where a Wi-Fi connection is not available, mobile cellular networks such as 3G or 4G can be utilized to access the system. By creating a wireless network within the home environment for controlling and monitoring the smart light, this project aims to enhance convenience and efficiency in household lighting management.
